This is a very old plugin that I wrote in 2011. It's a Python Object in which you can
write Python code and that code is executed during the `Draw()` function. Very useful
for testing and prototyping.

> __Note__: The code also looks like it was written back in 2011! I will update it
> soon to bring it up to speed with my current standards.
